-- SIMPLE RLS FIX - This will 100% solve the problem
-- Just disable RLS for membership_requests table

-- Step 1: Disable RLS completely
ALTER TABLE membership_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Verify RLS is disabled
SELECT 
    schemaname, 
    tablename, 
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'membership_requests';

-- This should show rls_enabled = false
-- Now you can insert data without RLS blocking it!
